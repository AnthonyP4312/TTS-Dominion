# TTS Dominion


This is a LUA script which automates certain parts of the card game Dominion on Tabletop Simulator

Supports 2-6 Players

This is my second mod for Tabletop Simulator. This time I tried to add some scripting to the game of Dominion. My goal was to automate as much of the bookkeeping of the game as I could. To this extent you'll find scripting here for each of the cards in the base set, with the exception of events which require player choice (Things like Chapel and Cellar). Everything else should be automated including the creation of the supply. Below is a list of all the functionality youll find or not find in this mod. 


Things this mod does:
Automatically create a supply (Random or a specific set) 
Keeps track of Treasure/Buy/Actions
Draws/Discards cards automatically
Calculates scores at the end of the game

Things this mod does NOT do:
Have AI or bots
Support any expansions

There are specific instructions on how to use the scripting in the notebook in the mod so please take a look at that if you're having any issues. Also if anything seems confusing or hard to understand please let me know and I'll see about changing it. Any feedback is welcome.


Given that this is a multiplayer game and that the supply is different every time there are bound to be a few scenarios I haven't tested for. If you think anything is working incorrectly please leave me a comment with what went wrong (the more information the better!) and I'll try to fix it as soon as possible.
